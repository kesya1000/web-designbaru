          ZORA (Amanda Manopo) has a younger sister, NINDA (Nicole Rossi), who suffers from schizophrenia. 
          But then a psychic named SEKAR (Sara Wijayanto) stated that Ninda was in fact an indigo, the owner 
          of a sixth sense that can see other worlds and currently Ninda's life is threatened by an invisible 
          figure who continues to bother her. To save him, Zora's help is needed. When he was little, Zora 
          turned out to be an indigo whose abilities had been closed. Now this ability must be unlocked again 
          in order to save his younger brother. And when his abilities open again, he must adapt to being an indigo, 
          facing figures from another world, while uncovering the mystery of a frightening past.
